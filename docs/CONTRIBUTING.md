# Contributing to Tressi

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

## 🚫 Current Status: Contributions Closed

**External contributions are not being accepted at this time.**

Tressi is still in early, active development. Its core architecture, APIs, and internal design are evolving quickly — and sometimes drastically — as I refine ideas and experiment with implementation strategies.

## 📌 Why Contributions Are Closed

- **Architectural Volatility**: The system design is in flux
- **Frequent Breaking Changes**: Stability is not yet a priority
- **Exploratory Phase**: Tressi is a learning project first

## 📬 You Can Still Help

Even though pull requests are closed, I welcome:

- 🐛 **Bug Reports** – Open an issue if something breaks
- 💡 **Feature Ideas** – Suggestions are appreciated!
- 🗣️ **Feedback** – General thoughts and encouragement are always welcome

## 🔮 Looking Ahead

Once the core stabilizes, I plan to reopen contributions with:

- Clear setup instructions
- Code style and linting rules
- Guidance for writing tests and submitting PRs

Thanks for your understanding and support!
