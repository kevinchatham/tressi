### **Performance Analysis Report for Tressi**

#### **1. Executive Summary**

The Tressi application is well-structured, but its original design contained significant architectural choices that negatively impacted performance, particularly under high-volume or long-duration load tests. The core issues stemmed from storing every request result in memory and repeatedly processing this growing dataset during the test run. These bottlenecks led to high memory consumption and increasing CPU usage as a test progressed, limiting the application's scalability.

---

#### **2. Critical Performance Bottlenecks**

These issues are likely to cause significant performance degradation or crashes during load tests.

- **Unbounded In-Memory Result Storage (`runner.ts`)**
  - **Observation:** The `Runner` class stored every single `RequestResult` object in the `this.results` array for the entire duration of the test. For a test running at 1,000 RPS for 5 minutes, this array would hold 300,000 objects.
  - **Impact:** This led to massive and continuously growing memory consumption, which could easily exhaust the available heap space and crash the Node.js process. It made the application unsuitable for large-scale tests.
  - **Code Reference:** `runner.ts:21`, `runner.ts:60`

- **Inefficient Real-time RPS and Autoscaling Calculations (`runner.ts`)**
  - **Observation:** The `getCurrentRps()` method, which was fundamental to the UI, logging, and autoscaling logic, calculated the requests per second by filtering the _entire_ `this.results` array. The autoscaler used this function every 2 seconds.
  - **Impact:** The complexity of this calculation was `O(N)`, where `N` was the total number of requests made so far. As the test ran, `N` grew, and this operation became progressively slower. This continuous, expensive filtering put unnecessary load on the CPU and caused the application's internal logic to slow down over time.
  - **Code Reference:** `runner.ts:150-155`

### **Follow-up Analysis (Current State)**

This analysis reviews the changes made to address the initial performance report. All major performance bottlenecks have been successfully resolved.

---

#### **1. DONE - Unbounded In-Memory Result Storage (`runner.ts`)**

- **Status:** **Addressed**
- **Observation:** The `runner.ts` file no longer stores every single latency value in an unbounded array. Instead, it now uses an **HDR Histogram** (`this.histogram`) to efficiently aggregate and store latency distributions without retaining individual latency values. Additionally, `this.sampledResults` is capped at 1,000 items, and `this.recentLatenciesForSpinner` and `this.recentRequestTimestamps` are bounded arrays used for specific, short-term purposes.
- **Impact:** This change effectively eliminates the risk of unbounded memory growth due to storing all request results or latency values, making the application suitable for large-scale tests.
- **Code Reference:** `runner.ts:78` (now refers to `this.sampledResults` cap), `runner.ts:100` (for `this.histogram`), `runner.ts:83` (for `this.recentLatenciesForSpinner`), `runner.ts:92` (for `this.recentRequestTimestamps`)

#### **2. DONE - Inefficient Real-time RPS and Autoscaling Calculations (`runner.ts`)**

- **Status:** **Addressed**
- **Observation:** The `getCurrentRps` method has been re-implemented to use a `CircularBuffer` for storing recent request timestamps. This avoids iterating over a large, growing array.
- **Impact:** This change makes the real-time RPS calculation highly efficient and scalable. The operation is now O(1) with respect to the total number of requests, eliminating the previous performance bottleneck entirely.
- **Code Reference:** `runner.ts:188-204`

---

#### **3. DONE - Expensive Live Statistical Calculations (`stats.ts`, `ui.ts`)**

- **Status:** **Addressed**
- **Observation:** The live statistical calculations have been optimized. The Terminal UI (`ui.ts`) now gets its data from the `Distribution` class, which calculates the latency distribution from an efficiently managed internal buffer. This avoids retrieving and processing a large, unbounded array of latencies in the UI loop.
- **Impact:** The high CPU usage problem in the UI loop has been eliminated. The UI is now responsive and performs efficiently regardless of the test duration.
- **Code References:** `ui.ts:150`, `distribution.ts:23`

---

#### **4. DONE - High Post-Test Processing Overhead (`summarizer.ts`, `exporter.ts`)**

- **Status:** **Addressed**
- **Observation:** The post-test processing functions (`generateSummary`, `generateMarkdownReport`, `exportDataFiles`) have been refactored to operate on the `runner` object directly. They now pull pre-aggregated, accurate data from the HDR Histogram and other efficient data structures within the runner.
- **Impact:** This change ensures that the final reports are both performant and correct. The processing step is now near-instantaneous and no longer depends on the size of the raw result set, while the final summary reflects the complete and accurate data from the entire test run.
- **Code References:** `summarizer.ts:205`, `index.ts:385`

### **Updated Conclusion**

The application's core architectural flaws have been successfully addressed. By adopting a **"streaming aggregation"** model using HDR Histograms and circular buffers, the application is now highly scalable and performant. The critical issues of unbounded memory growth, inefficient real-time calculations, and high post-test processing overhead have all been resolved, leading to a robust and reliable load testing tool.
