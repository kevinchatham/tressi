## Analysis & Warnings ⚠️

> *This section highlights potential performance issues or configuration problems detected during the test.*

* **Target RPS Unreachable**: The target of 1 RPS was not met. The test achieved ~0 RPS (40% of the target). Consider increasing workers or optimizing the service.
* **High Failure Rate**: The endpoint \`http://b.com\` had a failure rate of 50.0%. This may indicate a problem under load.
