## Analysis & Warnings ⚠️

> *This section highlights potential performance issues or configuration problems detected during the test.*

* **Target RPS Unreachable**: The target of 1 RPS was not met. The test achieved ~0 RPS (40% of the target). Based on the average latency of 238ms, you would need at least **2** workers to meet the target.
* **High Failure Rate**: The endpoint \`http://b.com\` had a failure rate of 50.0%. This may indicate a problem under load.

## Latency Distribution

> *This table shows how request latencies were distributed. **% of Total** is the percentage of requests that fell into that specific time range. **Cumulative %** is the running total, showing the percentage of requests at or below that latency.*

| Range (ms) | Count | % of Total | Cumulative % | Chart |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 100-149ms | 1 | 25% | 25% | ████████████████████ |
| 150-199ms | 1 | 25% | 50% | ████████████████████ |
| 200-249ms | 1 | 25% | 75% | ████████████████████ |
| 450+ms | 1 | 25% | 100% | ████████████████████ |

## Error Summary

> *This section summarizes any errors that occurred during the test, grouped by message.*
